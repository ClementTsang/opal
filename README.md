## Why...

See answers to some questions some people will likely have [here.](Why.md)

## Development

Note that opal was developed and built with:

- Rust 1.60.0 (it'll probably work with some older versions but this is what I tested on)
- Yew 0.19.3
- Tailwind 3.0.18

Additionally, opal relies on [`trunk`](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk) (0.15.0 as of writing) for building and
general development, where it handles building to WASM and running the Tailwind hook.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `setup.sh` to initialize all required SQLite databases. Note this will require `git`, `sqlite`, Python 3.9 or
   later, and `pandas` installed on your machine.
3. Install [`trunk`](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk). This is used to build things, as well as be a convenient tool
   for development.
4. Install some static HTTP server tool that supports byte ranges. I personally use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
5. Install [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
6. Run `trunk build`. If you're developing and want builds upon saving, use `trunk watch` instead. This will build
   to `./dist`.
7. In another terminal, run the HTTP server. For `http-server`, you can `cd dist/` and `http-server ./`
8. For release builds, run `trunk build --release`. For more details on optimizations, look at
   [the deploy workflow.](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml)

### Deployment

1. Build with `trunk build --release`.
2. Deploy the `dist/` folder. Note that the static webpage service you deploy to **must** properly support the
   `Accept-Ranges=bytes` header - otherwise, you are **very likely to face problems**! It's not fun trying to
   troubleshoot why SQLite complains of a malformed database on _only_ Firefox and incognito Chrome, or something
   like that. Weird things may happen if it isn't supported!

   As of writing, GitHub Pages should work fine, and Cloudflare Pages is supposed to support it in the future. I
   haven't looked into other static webpage services.
   
## Support

Currently, only English (and a specific subset at that) is supported. However, support for more sources or other languages may be added in the future, and theoretically isn't too hard to add.

## Credits

- The English (US) IPA mappings were created using [CMUdict](https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict) as a base
  (see [original license](https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict/blob/master/LICENSE)), converted from ARPABET to IPA following the
  mappings on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPABET).
- The entire idea of hosting a SQLite database on a static webpage comes from [phiresky's blog](https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2021/hosting-sqlite-databases-on-github-pages/),
  using their [sql.js-httpvfs](https://github.com/phiresky/sql.js-httpvfs), which I wrote [simple bindings for](https://github.com/ClementTsang/sql.js-httpvfs-rs).
- Written in [Yew](https://yew.rs/).
- Styling from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- Fonts used are from [Open Sans](https://github.com/googlefonts/opensans) and [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro).
